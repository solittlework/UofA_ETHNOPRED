  "readme": "delayed-job\n===========\ndelayed-job is a horizontally scalable implementation of Ruby's delayed_job. Using semaphore locks it aims to provide an atomic interface to a federation of workers operating on the same job queue. Initial work has focussed on a Redis backed database, however more backend implementations are possible.\n\n# Installation\n\n```\nnpm install delayed-job\n```\n\n# Usage\n```\nvar Scheduler = require('delayed-job');\n\nvar scheduler = Scheduler.createSchedule({\n  backend: {\n    name: 'redis',\n    jobHoldingBay: 'myUniqueListKey'\n  }\n});\n\nscheduler.on('job',function(job) {\n  console.log('Received job',job);\n});\n\nvar myJob = {\n  title: 'Great Gig In The Sky'\n};\n\nscheduler.delay(myJob,2000);\n```\n\n# API\n\n## schedular.delay(job,timeout)\nSchedule a job for execution\n\n# Assumptions\n* errors thrown will result in re-establishing the scheduler [expand]\n* Single atomic source of truth\n* Db interactions are also atomic\n* Jobs emitted have no immediate relationship to one another",
